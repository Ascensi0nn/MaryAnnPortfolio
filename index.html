                I'm Mary Ann Jacob (She/They), a first-year Graphic Design student at Rochester Institute of Technology. While I mainly focus on digital drawing, I love experimenting with different mediums.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                My art is fueled by a passion for creating change and evoking enthusiasm. Whether through community initiatives or personal projects, I aim to inspire new thoughts and emotions through my work. Join me as I continually add new artwork to my portfolio!

            <h4>
                In high school, I was deeply involved in mural art—I was president of the mural and art club and was in a selected murals class. Through these experiences, I've had the chance to contribute to and lead many events and projects. I've designed and created three large scale solo-personal murals within the school and one at a local business's shop, and 9 mobile mural panels that are now installed in in the Warren Wolf Elementary School. All of which are highlighted here.
                Murals are my passion, and I'm committed to continuing this journey!

            <h4>
                Recently, I've been exploring photography more seriously since acquiring a professional camera. However, my interest in photography has been long-standing—I've always found joy in capturing moments, whether it's the mundane details of everyday life, the beauty of the sky, or taking either photos of people, professional or candid.
                I aim to always collect these memories and encapsulate these emotions of the world around me.
                I have many more of these photos that I'll release soon too.

                This is the collection of posters I've designed, with many more to come as I start on this new hobby project to make many more. Alongside my original poster designs, I've also included mock-up layouts for my current CAB Application, featuring my unique illustration style inspired by previous CAB event posters.
